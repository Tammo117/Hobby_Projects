This Repository contrains a few projects performed to grapple with the basics of CFD and deep learning

1) K-Epsilon -- Built the K-Epsilon turbulence modedl from scratcht to model fluid flow in a 1D channel
2) MNSIT from scratch --  here I built a Neural Network from scratch using Numpy and tasked it with classfying the MNSIT dataset
3) MNSIT with pytorch -- MNSIT classification but then using Pytorch framework
4) CIFAR10 with Convnet -- classified the cifar images with a VGG inspired convolutional neural network
5) LSTM_Alice_wonderland -- with an LSTM generated new sentences of alice in wonderlands
6) Are GNNs Overkill -- An exploratory analysis where I compare GNNs to a vision learner on the benchmark molecular property prediction dataset MUTAG
