This Repository contrains a few projects performed to grapple with the basics of deep learning

There are 4 projects:
1) MNSIT from scratch --  here I built a Neural Network from scratch using Numpy and tasked it with classfying the MNSIT dataset
2) MNSIT with pytorch -- MNSIT classification but then using Pytorch framework
3) CIFAR10 with Convnet -- classified the cifar images with a VGG inspired convolutional neural network
4) LSTM_Alice_wonderland -- with an LSTM generated new sentences of alice in wonderlands
5) Are GNNs Overkill -- An exploratory analysis where I compare GNNs to a vision learner on the benchmark molecular property prediction dataset MUTAG
